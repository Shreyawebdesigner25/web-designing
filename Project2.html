<hr>
<h1 style="font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">Google was founded in September 1998 by <span style="color: blue"> Larry Page and Sergey Brin</span> while they were Ph.D. students at<span style="color: blue"> Stanford University in California</span>. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a California privately held company on September 4, 1998. Google was then reincorporated in Delaware on October 22, 2002.[12] An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the <span style="color: blue">Googleplex</span> . In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests.<span style="color: blue"> Sundar Pichai</span> was appointed<span style="color: blue"> CEO of Google</span> , replacing<span style="color: blue"> Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet</span> . In 2021, the Alphabet Workers Union was founded, mainly composed of Google employees.</h1>

	<hr>
	<h1 class="c">Google began in<span class="b"> January 1996</span> as a research project by<span class="b"> Larry Page</span> and<span class="b"> Sergey Brin</span> when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in Stanford, California.The project initially involved an unofficial<span class="b"> "third founder", Scott Hassan</span>, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original<span class="b"> Google Search engine</span>, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.
<br>
While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine originated from a misspelling of the word<span class="b"> "googol"</span> ,the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.
<br>
The domain name<span class="b"> www.google.com</span> was registered on September 15, 1997,and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998. It was based in the garage of a friend (<span class="b"> Susan Wojcicki</span>) in<span class="b"> Menlo Park, California</span> . Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.
<br>
Google was initially funded by an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from<span class="b"> Andy Bechtolsheim</span> , co-founder of<span class="b"> Sun Microsystems</span> ; the money was given before Google was incorporated.Google received money from three other<span class="b"> angel investors</span> in 1998:<span class="b"> Amazon.com</span> founder Jeff Bezos, Stanford University computer science professor<span class="b"> David Cheriton</span> , and entrepreneur<span class="b"> Ram Shriram</span> .Between these initial investors, friends, and family Google raised around 1 million dollars, which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in<span class="b"> Menlo Park, California</span></h1></p>
